        "readyToDump" flag.

	benefit of all WebKit hackerdom

        * Scripts/prepare-ChangeLog: Added.

2005-06-16  Darin Adler  <darin@apple.com>

        - recent changes to XcodeOptions made it depend on the current directory
          The intent was to have the WebKitBuild directory be next to WebKitTools,
          not inside the various build directories. Workaround for now is to call
          XcodeOptions when the directory is set to the WebKit directory.

        * Scripts/build-dumprendertree: Use a local variable for XcodeOptions and get it
        at the start of the script.

        to execute the cvs diff commands.

2005-06-11  Darin Adler  <darin@apple.com>

        - added first cuts at some cvs scripts

            cvs-abandon is for throwing away changes; discards any local changes, reverting to the state in CVS
            cvs-create-patch is for making patches; runs cvs diff with all the right options and handles added/deleted files
            cvs-apply is for applying patches; runs patch and cvs add and cvs rm
            cvs-unapply is for unapplying patches; does the opposite of cvs-apply

          An argument against these is "waste of time if we switch to Subversion", but they should be good for a while.

        * Scripts/cvs-abandon: Added.
        * Scripts/cvs-apply: Added.
