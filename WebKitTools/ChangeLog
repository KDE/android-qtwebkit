            cvs-unapply is for unapplying patches; does the opposite of cvs-apply

        - some build script enhancements

        * Scripts/build-dumprendertree: Changed to use webkitdirs.

        they are newer.
        * Scripts/run-safari: Reduce number of log messages, change to respect "-d" flag and get Development
        before Deplyment in that case.
        * Scripts/run-webkit-tests: Changed to use webkitdirs.
        * Scripts/update-webkit: Changed to use webkitdirs.

        * Scripts/run-safari: Fix to work with Xcode 2.0 again. The script would
	get confused because build-webkit now makes even 2.0 build directories look
	like 2.1.

        * DumpRenderTree/DumpRenderTree.xcode/project.pbxproj: Added Deployment build style.
        * Scripts/build-dumprendertree: For now, always use Deployment build style. This may fix things
        so we can run tests with Xcode 2.1.

        * Scripts/run-webkit-tests: Pass -L to find command to follow symlinks. This allows symlinks in the
        layout-tests directory to include additional sets of tests.
