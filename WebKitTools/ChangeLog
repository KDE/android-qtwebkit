          WebKit no longer builds after configuration supporting build changes

        * Scripts/webkitdirs.pm: Chomp off the result of `pwd`, and don't die when no Configuration file.

        * Scripts/update-webkit: Make this script work when called from any directory.

        Includes changes by Stuart Morgan as well as my own.

        * Scripts/build-dumprendertree: Call the new setConfiguration function, and use XcodeOptions instead of
        symrootXcodeOptions to set the -buildstyle option.
        * Scripts/build-webkit: Ditto. Also remove the old way of supporting Xcode 2.1 and the old --debug option.
        The new --development option does the same thing.
        * Scripts/run-safari: Ditto.
        * Scripts/run-webkit-tests: Ditto.
        * Scripts/update-webkit: Ditto.
        * Scripts/set-webkit-configuration: Added. Sets the default configuration to Development or Deployment.

        * Scripts/webkitdirs.pm: use FindBin to find the WebKit directory; works no matter what the current
        directory is when invoking a script. Add code to determine the Xcode version so we can do the right
        thing for 2.0 and 2.1. Change the productDir function to return the appropriate per-configuration
        product directory. Read the default configuration from a file, overridable by a passed-in command-line
        option.

        * Scripts/cvs-create-patch: Improve handling of directories with mixed CVS roots by going into each directory
        to execute the cvs diff commands.

2005-06-11  Darin Adler  <darin@apple.com>

        - added first cuts at some cvs scripts

            cvs-abandon is for throwing away changes; discards any local changes, reverting to the state in CVS
            cvs-create-patch is for making patches; runs cvs diff with all the right options and handles added/deleted files
            cvs-apply is for applying patches; runs patch and cvs add and cvs rm
            cvs-unapply is for unapplying patches; does the opposite of cvs-apply

          An argument against these is "waste of time if we switch to Subversion", but they should be good for a while.

        * Scripts/cvs-abandon: Added.
        * Scripts/cvs-apply: Added.
        * Scripts/cvs-create-patch: Added.
        * Scripts/cvs-unapply: Added.

          Build DumpRenderTree fails with unresolved NSAutoreleasePool, etc

        * DumpRenderTree/DumpRenderTree.xcode/project.pbxproj: Change type from "folder" to "wrapper.framework"
        for Foundation.framework. How was it ever wrong?

        - finally, I tested making the default build directory work; it works now

        * Scripts/webkitdirs.pm: Changed structure of the code a little bit, added symrootXcodeOptions function
        that sets SYMROOT on the command line in case there's no product directory set in Xcode preferences.
        * Scripts/build-webkit: Pass symrootXcodeOptions when invoking Xcode.
        * Scripts/build-dumprendertree: Ditto.

        * Scripts/webkitdirs.pm: Another try at making the default build directory of ~/WebKitBuild
        work. Someone should try building without setting the Xcode build product directory now,
        and let me know if it works.

        before Deplyment in that case.
