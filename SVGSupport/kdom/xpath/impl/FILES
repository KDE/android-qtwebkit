Here's roughly what the files in this directory, kdom/xpath/impl/, contains.

XPathFactory1Impl: 
	Factory for creating AST nodes for XPath 1.0. A factory for XPath 2.0 
	would likely be called XPathFactory2Impl

data/:
	Our simple "data library". Houses the four data types in XPath 1.0; Number,
	String, Boolean, and NodeSet. This should be replaced with a grande 
	Schema/XPath 2.0 Data Model library..

functions1/:
	XPath1 functions.
