=head1 NAME

email_in.pl - The Bugzilla Inbound Email Interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ./email_in.pl [-vvv] < email.txt

 Reads an email on STDIN (the standard input).

  Options:
    --verbose (-v) - Make the script print more to STDERR.
                     Specify multiple times to print even more.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script processes inbound email and creates a bug, or appends data
to an existing bug.

=head2 Creating a New Bug

The script expects to read an email with the following format:

 From: account@domain.com
 Subject: Bug Summary

 @product = ProductName
 @component = ComponentName
 @version = 1.0

 This is a bug description. It will be entered into the bug exactly as
 written here.

 It can be multiple paragraphs.

 -- 
 This is a signature line, and will be removed automatically, It will not
 be included in the bug description.

The C<@> labels can be any valid field name in Bugzilla that can be
set on C<enter_bug.cgi>. For the list of required field names, see 
L<Bugzilla::WebService::Bug/Create>. Note, that there is some difference
in the names of the required input fields between web and email interfaces, 
as listed below:

=over

=item *

C<platform> in web is C<@rep_platform> in email

=item *

C<severity> in web is C<@bug_severity> in email

=back

For the list of all field names, see the C<fielddefs> table in the database. 

The values for the fields can be split across multiple lines, but
note that a newline will be parsed as a single space, for the value.
So, for example:

 @short_desc = This is a very long
 description

Will be parsed as "This is a very long description".

If you specify C<@short_desc>, it will override the summary you specify
in the Subject header.

C<account@domain.com> must be a valid Bugzilla account.

Note that signatures must start with '-- ', the standard signature
border.

=head2 Modifying an Existing Bug

Bugzilla determines what bug you want to modify in one of two ways:

=over

=item *

Your subject starts with [Bug 123456] -- then it modifies bug 123456.

=item *

You include C<@bug_id = 123456> in the first lines of the email.

=back

If you do both, C<@bug_id> takes precedence.

You send your email in the same format as for creating a bug, except
that you only specify the fields you want to change. If the very
first non-blank line of the email doesn't begin with C<@>, then it
will be assumed that you are only adding a comment to the bug.

Note that when updating a bug, the C<Subject> header is ignored,
except for getting the bug ID. If you want to change the bug's summary,
you have to specify C<@short_desc> as one of the fields to change.

Please remember not to include any extra text in your emails, as that
text will also be added as a comment. This includes any text that your
email client automatically quoted and included, if this is a reply to
another email.

=head3 Adding/Removing CCs

You can't just add CCs to a bug by using the C<@cc> parameter like you
can when you're filing a bug. To add CCs, you can specify them in a
comma-separated list in C<@newcc>.

To remove CCs, specify them as a comma-separated list in C<@removecc>.

=head2 Errors

If your request cannot be completed for any reason, Bugzilla will
send an email back to you. If your request succeeds, Bugzilla will
not send you anything.

If any part of your request fails, all of it will fail. No partial
changes will happen.

There is no attachment support yet.

=head1 CAUTION

The script does not do any validation that the user is who they say
they are. That is, it accepts I<any> 'From' address, as long as it's
a valid Bugzilla account. So make sure that your MTA validates that
the message is actually coming from who it says it's coming from,
and only allow access to the inbound email system from people you trust.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Note that the email interface has the same limitations as the
normal Bugzilla interface. So, for example, you cannot reassign
a bug and change its status at the same time.

The email interface only accepts emails that are correctly formatted
perl RFC2822. If you send it an incorrectly formatted message, it
may behave in an unpredictable fashion.

You cannot send an HTML mail along with attachments. If you do, Bugzilla
will reject your email, saying that it doesn't contain any text. This
is a bug in L<Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper> that we can't work
around.

You cannot modify Flags through the email interface.
