=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::Webservice::Bug - The API for creating, changing, and getting the
details of bugs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This part of the Bugzilla API allows you to file a new bug in Bugzilla,
or get information about bugs that have already been filed.

=head1 METHODS

See L<Bugzilla::WebService> for a description of B<STABLE>, B<UNSTABLE>,
and B<EXPERIMENTAL>.

=head2 Utility Functions

=over

=item C<legal_values> B<EXPERIMENTAL>

=over

=item B<Description>

Tells you what values are allowed for a particular field.

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<field> - The name of the field you want information about.
This should be the same as the name you would use in L</create>, below.

=item C<product_id> - If you're picking a product-specific field, you have
to specify the id of the product you want the values for.

=back

=item B<Returns> 

C<values> - An array of strings: the legal values for this field.
The values will be sorted as they normally would be in Bugzilla.

=item B<Errors>

=over

=item 106 (Invalid Product)

You were required to specify a product, and either you didn't, or you
specified an invalid product (or a product that you can't access).

=item 108 (Invalid Field Name)

You specified a field that doesn't exist or isn't a drop-down field.

=back

=back


=back

=head2 Bug Creation and Modification

=over

=item C<get_bugs> B<EXPERIMENTAL>

=over

=item B<Description>

Gets information about particular bugs in the database.

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<ids>

An array of numbers and strings.

If an element in the array is entirely numeric, it represents a bug_id
from the Bugzilla database to fetch. If it contains any non-numeric 
characters, it is considered to be a bug alias instead, and the bug with 
that alias will be loaded. 

Note that it's possible for aliases to be disabled in Bugzilla, in which
case you will be told that you have specified an invalid bug_id if you
try to specify an alias. (It will be error 100.)

=back

=item B<Returns>

A hash containing a single element, C<bugs>. This is an array of hashes. 
Each hash contains the following items:

=over

=item id

C<int> The numeric bug_id of this bug.

=item alias

C<string> The alias of this bug. If there is no alias or aliases are 
disabled in this Bugzilla, this will be an empty string.

=item summary

C<string> The summary of this bug.

=item creation_time

C<dateTime> When the bug was created.

=item last_change_time

C<dateTime> When the bug was last changed.

=item internals B<UNSTABLE>

A hash. The internals of a L<Bugzilla::Bug> object. This is extremely
unstable, and you should only rely on this if you absolutely have to. The
structure of the hash may even change between point releases of Bugzilla.

=back

=item B<Errors>

=over

=item 100 (Invalid Bug Alias)

If you specified an alias and either: (a) the Bugzilla you're querying
doesn't support aliases or (b) there is no bug with that alias.

=item 101 (Invalid Bug ID)

The bug_id you specified doesn't exist in the database.

=item 102 (Access Denied)

You do not have access to the bug_id you specified.

=back

=back



=item C<create> B<EXPERIMENTAL>

=over

=item B<Description>

This allows you to create a new bug in Bugzilla. If you specify any
invalid fields, they will be ignored. If you specify any fields you
are not allowed to set, they will just be set to their defaults or ignored.

You cannot currently set all the items here that you can set on enter_bug.cgi.

The WebService interface may allow you to set things other than those listed
here, but realize that anything undocumented is B<UNSTABLE> and will very
likely change in the future.

=item B<Params>

Some params must be set, or an error will be thrown. These params are
marked B<Required>. 

Some parameters can have defaults set in Bugzilla, by the administrator.
If these parameters have defaults set, you can omit them. These parameters
are marked B<Defaulted>.

Clients that want to be able to interact uniformly with multiple
Bugzillas should always set both the params marked B<Required> and those 
marked B<Defaulted>, because some Bugzillas may not have defaults set
for B<Defaulted> parameters, and then this method will throw an error
if you don't specify them.

The descriptions of the parameters below are what they mean when Bugzilla is
being used to track software bugs. They may have other meanings in some
installations.

=over

=item C<product> (string) B<Required> - The name of the product the bug
is being filed against.

=item C<component> (string) B<Required> - The name of a component in the
product above.

=item C<summary> (string) B<Required> - A brief description of the bug being
filed.

=item C<version> (string) B<Required> - A version of the product above;
the version the bug was found in.

=item C<description> (string) B<Defaulted> - The initial description for 
this bug. Some Bugzilla installations require this to not be blank.

=item C<op_sys> (string) B<Defaulted> - The operating system the bug was
discovered on.

=item C<platform> (string) B<Defaulted> - What type of hardware the bug was
experienced on.

=item C<priority> (string) B<Defaulted> - What order the bug will be fixed
in by the developer, compared to the developer's other bugs.

=item C<severity> (string) B<Defaulted> - How severe the bug is.

=item C<alias> (string) - A brief alias for the bug that can be used 
instead of a bug number when accessing this bug. Must be unique in
all of this Bugzilla.

=item C<assigned_to> (username) - A user to assign this bug to, if you
don't want it to be assigned to the component owner.

=item C<cc> (array) - An array of usernames to CC on this bug.

=item C<qa_contact> (username) - If this installation has QA Contacts
enabled, you can set the QA Contact here if you don't want to use
the component's default QA Contact.

=item C<status> (string) - The status that this bug should start out as.
Note that only certain statuses can be set on bug creation.

=item C<target_milestone> (string) - A valid target milestone for this
product.

=back

In addition to the above parameters, if your installation has any custom
fields, you can set them just by passing in the name of the field and
its value as a string.

=item B<Returns>

A hash with one element, C<id>. This is the id of the newly-filed bug.

=item B<Errors>

=over

=item 103 (Invalid Alias)

The alias you specified is invalid for some reason. See the error message
for more details.

=item 104 (Invalid Field)

One of the drop-down fields has an invalid value. The error message will
have more detail.

=item 105 (Invalid Component)

Either you didn't specify a component, or the component you specified was
invalid.

=item 106 (Invalid Product)

Either you didn't specify a product, this product doesn't exist, or
you don't have permission to enter bugs in this product.

=item 107 (Invalid Summary)

You didn't specify a summary for the bug.

=item 504 (Invalid User)

Either the QA Contact, Assignee, or CC lists have some invalid user
in them. The error message will have more details.
