        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54260

        The method defaultDetailsSummaryText was added to LocalizationStrategy class. It is used to
        provide the default label to be used by a <details> tag that has no <summary> child.

        The URL of HTML5 Video Element is percent encoded at websites such as youtube.
        It is percent encoded again by QUrl constructor QUrl::QUrl(QString). This causes
        the HTTP GET request for the video to be rejected by the service provider. 
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53973.

        The bug is fixed by constructing QUrl from the encoded URL in 
        MediaPlayerPrivateQt::commitLoad. 

        New test function tst_QWebPage::loadHtml5Video() is added to load HTML content with
        HTML5 Video element. A new public method DumpRenderTreeSupportQt::mediaContentUrlByElementId
        is added to retrieve the URL of the media content from WebCore MediaPlayerPrivateQt.
        A new macro ENABLE_QT_MULTIMEDIA is introduced in tests.pri to make sure that the test
        is skipped if Qt Multimedia is not available.
