        REGRESSION (r61234): washingtonpost.com top bar looks wrong, doesn't animate

        Test: http/tests/local/absolute-url-strip-whitespace.html

        This was theoretically tested already in fast/url, however the
        tests were disabled due to lack of any clean way to test absolute
        url parsing in JavaScript.  I added a test which mimics the sites
        behavior using our local http server.  There seems to be no other
        way to test this at the moment.

         - Any char 0-20 should be removed (matches google-url and other browsers).

        Traverse the next sibling tree to find the text fragment for a first letter.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54568

        We cannot assume that the next sibling to the first letter will a text fragment
        since there can be intermediatary Apple-style-span inline elements wrapping the
        text fragment. So, we traverse the next sibling tree to find it.
