        Carriage returns were screwing up sunspider-compare-results on
        Windows.

        - New JavaScript benchmark
        http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15515
        
        A start on a new JavaScript benchmark, with standalone and
        browser-hosted drivers.
        
        The test content is still incomplete and the drivers could use
        some more features but there is enough here to make a good start.
        
        The drivers compute a 95% confidence interval on the mean for the
        whole test, each category, and each individual test to make it
        easier to tell whether differences are statistically
        significant. The confidence interval can be narrowed by running
        the test more times.
        
        * TODO: Added. Remaining things that need to be done.
