<h2>Building WebKit</h2>

<p>Before you build WebKit, you'll need to <a href="checkout.html">check out</a> sources. Next make sure that you have Xcode, preferably
the latest version, which is 2.2.1 at this point. You will need at least Xcode 2.1 to be able to build WebKit.<p>

<ol>

<li><p>To start a build, use the <tt>build-webkit</tt> script.</p>
<p class="code">WebKitTools/Scripts/build-webkit</p>
<p>It's handy to put the <tt>WebKitTools/Scripts</tt> directory in your shell path so you can type commands like <tt>build-webkit</tt> without specifying the path to the script.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Once the frameworks are built, you'll probably want to run Safari using the newly-built WebKit. To do that, use the <tt>run-safari</tt> script.</p>
<p class="code">WebKitTools/Scripts/run-safari</p>
<p>This script sets up the <tt>DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH</tt> environment variable, which will cause the system loader to use the
frameworks you built from your Xcode build products directory instead of the ones installed in /System/Library/Frameworks,
so it will start the version of Safari from the Applications directory with the WebKit frameworks you just built.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>If you have specified custom location for the build products directory in Xcode preferences, the frameworks will be built in that directory.
If you haven't, the build products will be put in a directory named WebKitBuild alongside the source code directories.</p>
<p>By default, the scripts will do a Release build, which is optimized and doesn't have debugging code, like assertions, compiled in.
If you'd prefer to do a Debug build, then execute this command:</p>
<p class="code">WebKitTools/Scripts/set-webkit-configuration --debug</p>
<p>You can also pass the configuration on the command line to any of the build commands.</p>
