<h3>You have found a bug? Here are 5 steps to getting it fixed!</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Check your WebKit version</strong><br>
<div id="unknown_version">
    To make sure you're not wasting your (and our) time, you should be using the latest version of WebKit before you file your bug.
    You should run at least Mac OS X 10.3.9 before filing bugs. Your WebKit version should be 312 or higher if you are on 
    Panther and 417 or higher if you are on Tiger. If you're running
    Mac OS X 10.4, you could also <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org">download the latest nightly</a> build to be sure you
    have the latest version. If you've done this and you still experience the bug, go ahead to the next step.
</div>
<div id="10point2" style="display: none;">
    We're sorry, we do not accept bugreports anymore from people using Mac OS X 10.2. To many bugs have been fixed since then. We advise
    you to upgrade to Mac OS X 10.4.
</div>
<div id="10point3" style="display: none;">
    <div id="updateto10_3_9" style="display: none;">
        You are using Mac OS X 10.3.8 or lower, please before filing any bugs, upgrade to Mac OS X 10.3.9.
    </div>
    <div id="update10_3_9_safari" style="display: none;">
        You are using Mac OS X 10.3.9, but your Safari isn't the latest version. Please, before filing any bugs, upgrade your Safari.
    </div>
    <div id="best10_3_9_safari">
        You are using Mac OS X 10.3.9, and the latest version of Safari, go ahead and file your bug!
    </div>
</div>
<div id="10point4" style="display: none;">
    <div id="neednewnightly" style="display: none;">
        You are already using a nightly build, which is very good! A large number of bugs has been fixed since you downloaded
        this nightly build though, so please <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">get the latest nightly</a>.
    </div>
    <div id="mightneednewnightly" style="display: none;">
        You are already using a nightly build, which is very good! Unfortunately, we can't detect when you downloaded it, but
        if that was more then a few days ago, please <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">get the latest nightly</a>.
    </div>
    <div id="updateto10_4_4" style="display: none;">
        You are using Mac OS X 10.4.3 or lower, please before filing any bugs, do either of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Upgrade to Mac OS X 10.4.4, or:</li>
            <li><a href="http://nightly.webkit.org">Download the latest nightly</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="10_4_4" style="display: none;">
        You are using Mac OS X 10.4.4, go ahead and file your bug, or if you want to <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org">
        download the latest nightly</a> and see if your bug is already fixed.
    </div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">get_version();</script>
</li>
<li>
    <strong>Search Bugzilla</strong><br>
    Now that you have the latest WebKit version and still think you've found a WebKit bug, 
    <a href="http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/query.cgi?format=specific&amp;product=WebKit">search through Bugzilla</a> first
    to see if anyone else has already filed it. This step is very important! If you find that someone has filed your bug
    already, please go to the next step anyway, but instead of filing a new bug, comment on the one you've found. If you can't
    find your bug in Bugzilla, go to the next step.
</li>
<li>
    <strong>Create a Bugzilla account</strong><br>
    You will need to <a href="http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/createaccount.cgi">sign up for a Bugzilla account</a> to be able
    to report bugs (and to comment on them). Once you have an account you can report bugs on any product on 
    <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org">OpenDarwin.org</a>. WebKit is one of the individual products listed in Bugzilla, and all 
    of our bugs can be classified in various components under the WebKit product. If you have registered, proceed to the
    next step.
</li>
<li>
    <strong>File the bug!</strong><br>
    Now you are ready to <a href="http://webkit.org/new-bug">file a bug on the WebKit product</a>. The <a href="bugwriting.html">
    Writing a Good Bug Report</a> document (also linked in the sidebar) gives some tips about the most useful information to include
    in bug reports. The better your bug report, the higher the chance that your bug will be addressed (and possibly fixed) 
    quickly!
</li>
<li>
    <strong>What happens next?</strong><br>
    Once your bug is filed, you will receive email when it is updated at each stage in the <a href="lifecycle.html">bug life cycle</a>.
    After the bug is considered fixed, you may be asked to download the <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org">latest nightly</a> 
    and confirm that the fix works for you.
</li>
</ol>
