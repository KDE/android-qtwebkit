<h3>Indenting</h3>

<ol>
<li> Use spaces to indent. Tabs should not appear in code files (with
     the exception of files that require them e.g. Makefiles).

<li> The indent size is 4 spaces.

<li> Code editors should be configured to expand tabs that you type to 4
spaces.
</ol>

<h3>Braces</h3>

<ol>
<li> Function definitions - open and close braces should be on lines by themselves. Do not put the open brace on the same line as the function signature. For example:

<pre>
    RIGHT:
    
        void foo()
        {
        }
        
        
    WRONG:
    
        void foo() {
        }

</pre>

<li> Loop control structures, including for, while and do statements - the open brace should go on the same line as the as the control structure. 

<pre>
    RIGHT:
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        }
                
    WRONG:
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
        {
        }

</pre>

<li> If/else statements - as above, but if there is an else clause, the close brace should go on the same line as the else.

<pre>
    RIGHT:

        if (timeToGetCoffee) {
	    buyCoffee(&coffee);
            chugIt(coffee);
        } else if (timeToGoHome)
            outtaHere = true;


    WRONG:

        if (timeToGetCoffee)
        {
	    buyCoffee(&coffee);
            chugIt(coffee);
        } else if (timeToGoHome) 
        {
            outtaHere = true;
        }
        
        if (timeToGetCoffee) {
        } 
	else if (timeToGoHome) 
            outtaHere = true;

</ol>

<h3>Parentheses</h3>

<ol>

<li>Function declarations and calls - do not use any spaces between the name and the open paren, inside the parentheses, or before commas that separate arguments. Do use a single space after commas that separate arguments.

<pre>
    RIGHT:

        int myFunction(int arg1, float arg2);
        void noArgFunction();

    WRONG:
        int myFunction (int arg1, float arg2);
        int myFunction( int arg1 , float arg2 );
        void noArgFunction ();
</pre>

<li>Control structures, such as if, while, do and switch - use a single space before the open paren, but no spaces inside the parentheses.

</ol>

<h3>Names</h3>

<ol><li>General Rule: With very few exceptions, prefer embedded
capitals instead of underscores for class, function and variable
names.

<li>C++ and Objective-C classes, interfaces and protocols, and other
type names - these names should start with a capital letter and use
InterCaps.

<pre>
    RIGHT:
    
        class MyImportantClass
        
    WRONG:
    
        class My_important_class
        class myImportantClass
</pre>
        
<li>Local variables should use interCaps, but the first word should
start with a lowercase letter, like this:

<pre>
    RIGHT:
    
        int myInt;
        
    WRONG:
    
        int MyInt;
        int my_int;
</pre>
        
<li>Free function names in C++ should follow the same naming
conventions as local variables. Most functions should be named to
sound like verb phrases, like "openDoor" or
"walkAroundTheBlock". (getters, setters, predicates?)

<li>C++ data members should be named like local variables, but with a
prefix of m_.

<li>C++ member functions should follow the same naming convention as
free functions.

<li>Objective-C methods should follow the usual Cocoa naming style -
they should read like a phrase or sentence and each piece of the
selector should start with a lowercase letter and use intercaps.

<li>Objective-C instance variables should be named like local
variables but starting with an underscore.

<li>Pointer and reference types - pointer types should be written with
a space between the type name and the * (so the * is adjacent to the
following identifier if any). For reference types, the &amp; goes next to
the type name.


<li>Enum members should user InterCaps with an initial capital letter.

<li>#defined constants should use all uppercase names with words
separated by underscores.

<li> Macros that expand to function calls or other non-constant
     computation: these should be named like functions, and should
     have parentheses at the end, even if they take no arguments (with
     the exception of some special macros like ASSERT):

<pre>
    RIGHT:
        #define WBStopButtonTitle()  NSLocalizedString(@"Stop", @"Go/Stop button title when busy")

    WRONG:
        #define WB_STOP_BUTTON_TITLE  NSLocalizedString(@"Stop", @"Go/Stop button title when busy")
        #define WBStopButtontitle  NSLocalizedString(@"Stop", @"Go/Stop button title when busy")
</pre>

<li> Acronyms in names: If an identifier includes an acronym, make the
     acronym all-uppercase or all-lowercase, depending on whether a
     word in that position would be capitalized or not.

<pre>
    RIGHT:

        urlVariable
        myURLAccessor:

    WRONG:

        uRLVariable
        myUrlAccessor:
</pre>
</ol>
