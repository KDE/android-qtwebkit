        * Bakefiles.bkgen: 
        Added Bakefile build configuration file
        
        * update-file-lists.py:
        Added script to generate cross-platform sources list from Win VCProject files.
        
        * presets.bkl: 
        Added Bakefile containing templates for WebCore pre-requisites, like
