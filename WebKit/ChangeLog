	- fixed 3117193 -- REGRESSION: Hang on Hixie's weblog

        Reviewed by Maciej.

        * WebCoreSupport.subproj/WebTextRenderer.m:
        (-[WebTextRenderer substituteFontForString:families:]):
	Do the operation on the whole string at once instead of a character at a time.
        I decided to do this rather than correct the bug in the character-at-a-time version.
