        so that the whole thing is not inside an if statement. Also don't hold a
        reference to the DOM element if there is no error to report.
        (-[WebNullPluginView reportFailure]): Added. Does the actual delegate
        callback. Happens back at the top level of the run loop so it doesn't
        fire deep inside layout. Also wrote this so that it is guaranteed not to
        reenter and so that it can handle the case where the delegate destroys
        the world (including this object). NOTE: This is not a real, general
        solution to the problem of plug-ins that do work inside layout. We will need
        a more general fix that works for other plug-ins, and we'll track that with
