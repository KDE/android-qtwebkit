	- Moved the WebKit error registration out of WebView because apps that use WebKit but not WebView might need to use WebKit errors (like my test app for WebDownload).
	- Added file close and file move errors (needed for WebDownload).

	Following the recent fix for ensuring that we always have a FormDelegate,
	when we need a default policy delegate we use a shared one instead of allocing
	a new one each time, which then would leak.

	WebDefaultPolicyDelegate API.  The arg was not used.

	3158240 - cursor does not track when switching from panels to safari windows

	Two changes here:  First, we post fake mousemoved events to get the cursor fixed up
	without checking if the mouse is down (WC deals with that now).  That fixes 2940179,
	because the button is down when we get notified of becoming key.

	Second, we observe key window instead of main window notifications everywhere, so we

	Fixed problem where we weren't stopping the Java plug-in. This problem was introduced on Jan. 1 when the ownership of the WebPluginController was moved from WebFrame to WebDataSource. This change moves the WebPluginController to the WebHTMLView. Why this


 change?

	- The state of the plug-ins (currently only the Java plug-in) completely relies on the state of the WebHTMLView, not on the state of the WebDataSource.

	- WebHTMLView and WebDataSource are usually coupled via WebView and WebFrame, but not always. In a transitional state, the WebHTMLView may not be up to date with the WebDataSource.

	- WebPluginController controls an array of views. It makes more sense for this object to be owned by a view (WebHTMLView) not a model.

	- fixed 3152427 -- Need unique IDs for bookmarks, for 
	synching's sake

	Bookmarks now have a UUID string so that each can maintain its identity
	even in the face of multi-machine synching. One known loose end is written 
	up in 3153832 (unique IDs in bookmarks aren't preserved correctly after copy/paste).
	This should be good enough now for the iSynch folks to start implementing
	the bookmarks-synching conduit.

	I also did some cleanup in this area to share more code and handle
	init methods more cleanly, inspired by earlier feedback from Trey and Darin.

	Fixed: 3131714 - System becomes unresponsive while downloading

	While downloading a file, Safari and the Finder take up 30%-40% of the CPU each. This is happening because for every chunk of data we write to disk, we call -[NSWorkspace noteFileSystemChanged:]. noteFileSystemChanged is inefficient. It calls 2 AppleEven


ts each with 60 timeouts. The event also cause the Finder to do a lot of work.

	We should:
	- Send 1 AppleEvent ourselves with no timeout since we don't care about the reply
	- Call the notification/event less often. The only benefit of sending the event for every chunk written is that the file size updates in the Finder. Not worth the performance impact.

        Many changes for b/f list.
        1.  Always attempt to cache snap back items.
        2.  Lazily release resources from page cache.  This garners gains on the PLT (and presumably iBench) tests, both for uncached.
        3.  Set the page cache size to 4 (+ snap back items).  After releasing resources we hover around 28MB footprint.  Closing windows releases all resources.
        4.  Turn on the back/forward cache by default.  The menu item still allows you to toggle b/f on and off.  Useful when conducting speed comparison in the PLT.
        5.  Addition of lazy update to PLT memory statistics to show footprint after lazy release of page cache resources.
        6.  Delayed to leak detector to account for lazy release of resources.
        7.  A change when saving a page to back/forward cache to clear and restore the documents root renderer.  Without this fix pages would appear to 'flicker' more when content arrived.
        8.  A change to ensure a layout when restoring a page from the b/f cache.  Without this fix scrollbars wouldn't appear correctly.
        9.  A change to ensure that khtmlview layout and paint timers are unscheduled when a page is placed in the b/f cache.
        10.  A fix to decouple of khtmlview from it's part when placed in the b/f cache.  This fixed a crash caused by inappropriate deference of the part when a page cache item was released.
        11.  A comment in KHTMLPageCache.h explaining the that our page cache is not the same as the khtml page cache.  (Their cache just cached the html source.)
        12.  Reapply styles when loading page from cache.  This ensures that visited link get the appropriate style.

	3097585 - Crash in -[WebFrame(WebPrivate) _isLoadComplete] at result of google image search

	The root of this problem was that we would detach child frames by calling detach
	on them all, then clearing the whole array.  This would fail because detaching a
	frame might have to stop a load, which calls checkLoadComplete, which visits the
	entire frame tree.  But if a previously detached child is still sitting in that
	tree, we end up with an assertion failure.  The solution is to remove the kids as
	they are detached.
