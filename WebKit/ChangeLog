        Fix 64-bit Mac build.

        * WebKit.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Change paths specified relative to SRCROOT
        to be relative to PROJECT_DIR.  PROJECT_DIR takes into account the projectDirPath
        setting of the project, which in this instance includes the necessary "mac"
        subdirectory.
