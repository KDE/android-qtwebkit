        Replaced NS_DURING/NS_HANDLER with @try/@catch throughout WebKit

        I made the following changes:
        - replaced NS_DURING with @try, and added opening brace if there wasn't one
        - replaced NS_HANDLER with @catch (NSException *localException), and added braces if there weren't any
        - removed NS_ENDHANDLER, and added a closing brace if there wasn't one
        - in a couple of places, fixed indentation therein

        * Misc/WebIconDatabase.mm:
        (objectFromPathForKey):
        * WebView/WebHTMLView.mm:
        (-[WebHTMLView drawSingleRect:]):
        (-[WebHTMLView beginDocument]):
        (-[WebHTMLView deleteToMark:]):
        * WebView/WebView.mm:
        (-[WebView initWithCoder:]):
