What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.2?

  - Added support for downloads: a new signal, 'download-requested',
    will be emitted by WebKit when a dowload is requested. On top of
    that, the download process has been encapsulated in a new object,
    WebKitDownload, which allows the user to control it or to start
    new downloads from the client side.
  - Added webkit_web_view_get_encoding to get the automatic encoding
    of the current page.
  - Added GObject properties for 'encoding' and 'custom-encoding'.
  - Added 'javascript-profiling-enabled' property to the WebInspector,
    which allows to enable and disable the profiling functionality.
  - Added API to create and add history items to WebKit's history.
  - Improved debugging support with WEBKIT_DEBUG environment
    variable. Most of the settings will only give useful output for
    debug builds, but WEBKIT_DEBUG=Network will log all HTTP traffic
    form libsoup to console. See WebCore/platform/gtk/LoggingGtk.cpp
    for all the options available.
  - Lots of bugfixes.
