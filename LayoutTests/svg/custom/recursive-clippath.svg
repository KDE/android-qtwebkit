<!--
Spec: clip-path: If the IRI reference is not valid (e.g it points to an object that doesn't exist or the object
                 is not a ‘clipPath’ element) the ‘clip-path’ property must be treated as if it hadn't been specified.

      Our view is that an clipPath containing a cycle is not valid, and thus should be ignored.
      But the object that references the clipPath should still be drawn.
