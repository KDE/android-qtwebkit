This tests that resources in the body which block parsing (script, css) are preloaded
ahead of other resources (images). It requires DumpRenderTree to see the log of what
resources are loaded.
<img src=resources/image1.png>
<script src=resources/script1.js></script>
<style>
  @import "resources/style1.css";
</style>
</body>
</html>
