This test ensures WebGL implementations handle uniformMatrix in a OpenGL ES 2.0 spec compliant way

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Checking gl.uniformMatrix.
PASS can call uniformMatrix2fvwith transpose = false
PASS uniformMatrix2fv should return INVALID_VALUE with transpose = true
PASS can call uniformMatrix3fvwith transpose = false
PASS uniformMatrix3fv should return INVALID_VALUE with transpose = true
PASS can call uniformMatrix4fvwith transpose = false
PASS uniformMatrix4fv should return INVALID_VALUE with transpose = true
