This tests the behaviour of a number of the DOM Canvas drawing methods when
given 0, inf, or NaN as parameters.
A number of the Canvas methods do not have defined behaviour when given inf
or nan and so we use UNDEFINED to indicate this.

PASS called fillRect 0*0 fillRect without throwing an exception.
UNDEFINED called fillRect with inf*inf fillRect without throwing an exception.
UNDEFINED threw exception code 1 on nan*nan fillRect.
PASS called clearRect 0*0 clearRect without throwing an exception.
UNDEFINED called clearRect with inf*inf clearRect without throwing an exception.
UNDEFINED threw exception code 1 on nan*nan clearRect.
PASS called rect 0*0 rect without throwing an exception.
UNDEFINED called rect with inf*inf rect without throwing an exception.
UNDEFINED threw exception code 1 on nan*nan rect.
PASS called fill with an empty path without throwing an exception.
