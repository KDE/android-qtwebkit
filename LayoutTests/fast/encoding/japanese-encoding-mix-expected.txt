Some text here is encoded as EUC-JP, and some as Shift_JIS. Since there is an explicit encoding declaration, auto-detection shouldn't change the encoding.

Interestingly, IE8's View Source somehow sucessfully decodes both paragraphs below, switching encodings on the fly, but its normal HTML display does not do this. Also, the Shift_JIS text contains some characters in 0x80...0x9d range that are handled as invalid by other browsers, but ICU thinks that these codes are compatible with Latin-1. So, expected output may vary somewhat.
