This automated layout test checks that effectAllowed and dropEffect are set properly in drag callbacks.
If you're running this in a browser, you can simulate part of it by dragging Abe onto the box.

*** Testing a successful drag...
PASS effectAllowed in dragStart = 'uninitialized'
PASS dropEffect in dragStart = 'none'
PASS effectAllowed in dragEnter = 'copyMove'
PASS dropEffect in dragEnter = 'copy'
PASS effectAllowed in drop = 'copyMove'
PASS dropEffect in drop = 'move'
PASS effectAllowed in dragEnd = 'copyMove'
PASS dropEffect in dragEnd = 'move'
PASS calls to dragStart = '1'
PASS calls to dragEnd = '1'
PASS calls to dragEnter = '1'
PASS calls to drop = '1'
*** Testing a failed drag...
