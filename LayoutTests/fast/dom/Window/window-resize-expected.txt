This test makes sure that we have similar behavior as other browsers when resizing and moving a window outside of the screen. This test will fail in some dimensions when run manually because of inconsistencies of when the window can and cannot go behind the doc.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
