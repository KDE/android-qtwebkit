Test that the second argument of window.postMessage is ignored if it is not a message port. You should see messages '1' through '6', followed by 'done', received below.

Note that the HTML5 spec implies that an exception should be raised instead, so this test will need updating once that new behavior is implemented.

Received message '1'
Received message '2'
Received message '3'
Received message '4'
Received message '5'
Received message '6'
Received message 'done'
