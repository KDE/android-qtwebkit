This test checks to see whether you get exceptions when setting a property with a "bad value". We preserve our historic behavior of never raising an exception when you set a CSS property using JavaScript property syntax. But we do raise exceptions when setting a property with setProperty.

The results below should show four successes, followed by two exceptions.

This is the test element.

Successfully set display to "block"; value is now "block".
Successfully set display to ""; value is now "".
Successfully set display to null; value is now "".
Successfully set display to "block" with setProperty; value is now "block".
Got exception trying to set display to "" with setProperty; value is now "".
Got exception trying to set display to null with setProperty; value is now "".
