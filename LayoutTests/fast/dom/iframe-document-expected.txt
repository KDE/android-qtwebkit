This tests the document property on an HTMLIFrameElement. Internet Explorer and Safari have a document property on all elements that gives the document the element is in. Old versions of Safari overrode this on iframe elements to return the document inside the iframe, which created an incompatibility with at least on SAP application because it doesn't match the behavior of other browsers.

TEST PASSED: The document property is returning the document the iframe element is in.
