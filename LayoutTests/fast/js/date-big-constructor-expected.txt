This test case checks that months greater than 11 are handled correctly when passed to the Date constructor and the Date.UTC function. The ECMA 262 specification says that months > 11 should be treated as month % 12 and the year as year + floor(month / 12). The expected output on success is "Success!" below. On failure a list of differences between expected and actual output will be shown.

Success!
