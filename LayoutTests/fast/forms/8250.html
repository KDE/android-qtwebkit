<p>This is a test for 8250.  The khtmlBeforeTextInserted event handler wasn't being told about interchange newlines.  You shouldn't see anything in the text field.</p>
<input id="test" type="text">

<script>
var e = document.getElementById("test");
e.focus();
e.setSelectionRange(0, 0);

document.execCommand("InsertHTML", false, "<br class='Apple-interchange-newline'>foo");
