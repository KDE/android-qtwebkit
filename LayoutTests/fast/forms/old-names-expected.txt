This tests accessing form elements by name. IE only lets you look up names under the first name the element had and does not respond to name changes. Firefox will let each element be looked up under its original name as long as no actual element has that name. This test has been written to expect the Firefox behavior. This original name quirk applies only to the syntax form.name and not to the form.elements collection.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
