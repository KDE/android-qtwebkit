<title>Marquee Test for half of Radar 4172312 and www.munsterrugby.ie</title>
<body> 

    <p>Tests: the height attribute for the marquee tag<br>
    </p>
    <p>Conditions:<br>
    Because marquee is a WinIE element, we are honoring their treatment of the heigh attribute by making sure it is overriden when the given
    height is smaller than the font height.
    </p>
    <p>If successful, the pink marquee should be large, and the others should all be the same size. None of the text should be cut off.
