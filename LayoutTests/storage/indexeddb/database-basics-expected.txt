Test the basics of IndexedDB's IDBDatabase.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


indexedDB.open('name', 'description')
PASS 'onsuccess' in result is true
PASS 'onerror' in result is true
PASS 'abort' in result is true
PASS 'readyState' in result is true
An event should fire shortly...

Success event fired:
PASS 'result' in event is true
PASS 'code' in event is false

PASS event.source != null is true
PASS 'onsuccess' in event.target is true
PASS 'onerror' in event.target is true
PASS 'abort' in event.target is true
PASS 'readyState' in event.target is true
PASS event.target.readyState is event.target.DONE

db = event.result
PASS db.name is "name"
PASS db.objectStores is []
PASS db.objectStores.length is 0
PASS db.objectStores.contains('') is false

db.setVersion("version a")
PASS 'onsuccess' in result is true
PASS 'onerror' in result is true
