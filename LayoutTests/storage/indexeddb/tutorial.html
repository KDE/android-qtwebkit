// This is a tutorial that highlights many of the features of IndexedDB along witha number of
// caveats that currently exist in Chromium/WebKit but which will hopefully be improved upon
// over time.
//
// The latest version of the spec can be found here:
// http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/IndexedDB/raw-file/tip/Overview.html but note that there are quite a
// few bugs currently opened against it and some major unresolved issues (like whether dynamic
// transactions should be in for v1). Many of the bugs are filed here:
// http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&component=Indexed+Database+API&longdesc_type=allwordssubstr&longdesc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bug_id_type=anyexact&bug_id=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&known_name=IndexedDB&query_based_on=IndexedDB&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=
// Discussion happens on public-webapps@w3.org
//
// Although not user friendly, additional capabilities and example code can be found in the
// tests for IndexedDB which are here:
// http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/LayoutTests/storage/indexeddb
//
// This document is currently maintained by Jeremy Orlow <jorlow@chromium.org>


// This is not an ideal layout test since it doesn't verify things as thoroughly as it could,
// but adding such content would make it much more cluttered and thus wouldn't serve its primary
// goal of teaching people IndexedDB. That said, it does have a good amount of coverage and
// serves as a living document describing what's expected to work and how within WebKit so it
// seems well worth having checked in.

    // The IDBDatabase object has a "version" attribute. This can only be set by calling

function onSetVersion()
{
    // We are now in a setVersion transaction. Such a transaction is the only place where one
    // can add or remove indexes and objectStores. The result (property of event) is an

    while (db.objectStores.length)
        db.removeObjectStore(db.objectStores[0]);

    // Now that we have a blank slate, let's create an objectStore. An objectStore is simply an
    // ordered mapping of keys to values. We can iterate through ranges of keys or do individual
    // lookups. ObjectStores don't have any schema.
    //
    // Keys can be integers, strings, or null. (The spec also defines dates and there's talk of
    // handling arrays, but these are not implemented yet in Chromium/WebKit.) Values can be
    // anything supported by the structured clone algorithm
    // (http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#internal-structured-cloning-algorithm) which
    // is a superset of what can be expressed in JSON. (Note that Chromium/WebKit does not fully
    // implement the structured clone algorithm yet, but it definitely handles anything JSON
    // serializable.)
    //
    // There are two types of objectStores: ones where the path is supplied manually every time a
    // value is inserted and those with a "key path". A keyPath is essentially a JavaScript
    // expression that is evaluated on every value to extract a key. For example, if you pass in
    // the value of "{fname: 'john', lname: 'doe', address: {street: 'Buckingham Palace", number:
    // 76}, siblings: ["Nancy", "Marcus"], id: 22}" and an objectStore has a keyPath of "id" then
    // 22 will be the key for this value. In objectStores, each key must be unique.
    //
    // Note that the exact syntax allowed for keyPaths is not yet well specified, but
    // Chromium/WebKit currently allows paths that are multiple levels deep within an object and
    // allows that to be intermixed with array dereferences. So, for example, a key path of
    // "address.number" or "siblings[0]" would be legal (provided every entry had an address with
    // a number attribute and at least one sibling). You can even go wild and say
    // "foo[0][2].bar[0].baz.test[1][2][3]". It's possible this will change in the future though.
    //
    // If you set autoIncrement (the third optional parameter), IndexedDB will generate a key
    // for your entry automatically. And if you have a keyPath set, it'll set the value at
    // the location of the keyPath _in the database_ (i.e. it will not modify the value you pass
    // in to put/add). Unfortunately autoIncrement is not yet implemented in Chromium/WebKit.
    //
    // Let's now create an objectStore for people. We'll supply a key path in this case.
    var objectStore = db.createObjectStore("people", "id");

    // Notice that it returned synchronously. The rule of thumb is that any call that touches (in
    // any way) keys or values is asynchronous and any other call (besides setVersion and open) are
    // asynchronous.
    //
    // Now let's create some indexes. Indexes allow you to create other keys via key paths which
    // will also point to a particular value in an objectStore. In this example, we'll create
    // indexes for a persons first and last name. Indexes can optionally be specified to not be
    // unique, which is good in the case of names. The first parameter is the name of the index.
    // Second is the key path. The third specifies uniqueness.
    var fname = objectStore.createIndex("fname", "fname", false);
    var lname = objectStore.createIndex("lname", "lname", false);

    // Note that if you wanted to delete these indexes, you can either call objectStore.removeIndex
    // or simply delete the objectStores that own the indexes. (Note that removeObjectStore and
    // removeIndex may be changed to deleteObjectStore and deleteIndex in the future.)
    //
    // If we wanted to, we could populate the objectStore with some data here or do anything else
    // allowed in a normal (i.e. non-setVersion) transaction. This is useful so that data migrations
    // can be atomic with changes to the objectStores/indexes.
    //    
    // Because we haven't actually made any new asynchronous requests, this transaction will
    // start committing as soon as we leave this function. This will cause oncomplete event handler
    // for the transaction will fire shortly after. IndexedDB transactions commit whenever control is
    // returned from JavaScript with no further work being queued up against the transaction. This
    // means one cannot call setTimeout, do an XHR, or anything like that and expect my transaction
    // to still be around when that completes.

    // parameters are optional for transaction.
    //
    // The first specifies which object stores to lock. The spec specifies "dynamic transactions"
    // which don't require this and which have finer grained locks, but no one yet supports this and
    // it may even be dropped from the first version of the spec, so I don't suggest you rely on it.
    // Chromium/WebKit also does not yet support anything finer grained than database level locking,
    // so in this tutorial we'll just pass in the empty array which means "lock the world".
    //
    // The second parameter specifies the locking mode. The default is READ_ONLY (i.e. a shared lock).
    // That's fine for this case, but later we'll ask for IDBTransaction.READ_WRITE. At the moment,
    // Chromium/WebKit pretends every transaction is READ_WRITE, which is kind of bad. (Note that
    // SNAPSHOT_READ will soon be removed from the spec.)

// The way setVersion is supposed to work:
//   To keep things simple to begin with, objectStores and indexes can only be created in a setVersion
// transaction and one can only run if no other connections are open to the database. This is designed
// to save app developers from having an older verison of a web page that expects a certain set of
// objectStores and indexes from breaking in odd ways when things get changed out from underneith it.
// In the future, we'll probably add a more advanced mechanism, but this is it for now.
//   Because a setVersion transaction could stall out nearly forever until the user closes windows,
// we've added a "blocked" event to the request object returned by setVersion. This will fire if the
// setVersion transaction can't begin because other windows have an open connection. The app can then
// either pop something up telling the user to close windows or it can tell the other windows to call
// .close() on their database handle. .close() halts any new transactions from starting and waits for
// the existing ones to finish. It then closes the connection and any indexedDB calls afterwards are
// invalid (they'll probably throw, but this isn't specified yet). We may specify .close() to return
// an IDBRequest object so that we can fire the onsuccess when the close completes.
//   Once inside a setVersion transaction, you can do anything you'd like. The one connection which
// was allowed to stay open to complete the setVersion transaction will stay alive. Multiple
// setVersion transactions can be queued up at once and will fire in the order queued (though
// this obviously only works if they're queued in the same page).
//
// The current status of setVersion in Chromium/WebKit:
//   In Chromium/WebKit we currently don't enforce the "all connections must be closed before a
// setVersion transaction starts" rule. We also don't implement database.close() or have a blocked
// event on the request .setVersion() returns.
//
// The current status of workers:
//   Chromium/WebKit do not yet support workers using IndexedDB. Support for the async interface
// will likely come before the sync interface. For now, a work-around is using postMessage to tell
// the page what to do on the worker's behalf in an ad-hoc manner. Anything that can be serialized
// to disk can be serialized for postMessage.
