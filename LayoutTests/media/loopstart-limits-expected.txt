  
Test loopstart attribute parsing, limits, and defaults.

<video loopstart=1.5> - loopstart specified, should not change
expected video.loopStart=='1.5', observed '1.5' - OK
expected audio.loopStart=='1.5', observed '1.5' - OK

<video start=1.0> - loopstart not specified, should return start attr
expected video.loopStart=='1', observed '1' - OK
expected audio.loopStart=='1', observed '1' - OK

<video> - no loopstart and no start, default should be 0
expected video.loopStart=='0', observed '0' - OK
expected audio.loopStart=='0', observed '0' - OK

<video loopstart='s1.0'> - bogus loopstart and no start, default should be 0 (start default)
expected video.loopStart=='0', observed '0' - OK
expected audio.loopStart=='0', observed '0' - OK

<video loopstart='s1.0' start=1.0> - bogus loopstart, default should be start attr
expected video.loopStart=='1', observed '1' - OK
expected audio.loopStart=='1', observed '1' - OK
END OF TEST
