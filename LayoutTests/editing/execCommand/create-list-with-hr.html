<p>This test pushes a horizontal rule into an unordered list with InsertUnorderedList. <b>The fact that the horizontal rule is put into an unnecessary div when it's pushed into the list might be considered a bug. </b><b>The fact that the caret isn't preserved is a bug.</b></p>
<div contenteditable="true" id="div"><hr></div>
