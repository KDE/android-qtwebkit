        - <rdar://problem/5536630> fast/dom/Window/new-window-opener.html fails
        - This test used to pass because of a mistake in js-test-pre.js.
        Now that the js file has been fixed this test has been updated, some
        of the test cases fail because DRT does not implement delegate methods
        for the bars for each WebView.
        - See <rdar://problem/5538752> DumpRenderTree does not have a UIDelegate for each WebView.

        - Also changed the test to correctly wait for the window to close before
        starting a new testcase.  This is necessary because all the windows have
        the same name and cannot override the settings of a pre-existing window.

        Rubberstamped by Eric.

        Move current layout tests results from platform/mac/svg to platform/mac-tiger/svg.
        The problem is that the current results have accidently been generated with Leopard,
        I'm still moving this to mac-tiger so we don't loose the history for all the results.
        After this commit, the baseline will be regenerated in mac-tiger/svg, and someone with
        Leopard needs to generate new results in mac-leopard/svg.
