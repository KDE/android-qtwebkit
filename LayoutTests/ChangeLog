        Unreviewed move of Chromium baselines.
        
        In preparation for making pixel tests pass for Chromium on Snow Leopard,
        move baselines for 273 tests from chromium-mac to chromium-mac-leopard.
        These tests will then use the mac baselines, which will enable them
        to pass on Snow Leopard, but keep passing for Leopard too.

        List of files omitted due to length but composed entirely of moves from
        platform/chromium-mac to platform/chromium-mac-leopard.
