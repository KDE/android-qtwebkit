        HTML5 TreeBuilder regressed a Peacekeeper DOM test by 40%
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48719

        It's unclear exactly what the Peacekeeper benchmark is testing,
        because I haven't found a way to run it myself.

        However, I constructed a benchmark which shows at least one possible slow point.
        The HTML5 spec talks about creating a new document for every time we use
        the fragment parsing algorithm.  Document() it turns out, it a huge bloated
        mess, and the constructor and destructor do a huge amount of work.
        To avoid constructing (or destructing) documents for each innerHTML call,
        this patch adds a shared dummy document used by all innerHTML calls.

        * benchmarks/parser/tiny-innerHTML.html: Added.
