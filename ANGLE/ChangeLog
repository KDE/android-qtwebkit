        Clean up the ANGLE Xcode project.

        Main changes include:
        • Adding a Production configuration.
        • Modifying the library name from libangle.a to libANGLE.a.
        • Installing the headers in a subdirectory of /usr/local/include to avoid polluting the top-level directory.
        • Generating derived sources in to the built products directory so they're saved along with the symroot.
        • Switching to using .xcconfig files for maximum cleanliness.

        * ANGLE.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
        * Configurations/ANGLE.xcconfig: Added.
        * Configurations/Base.xcconfig: Added.
        * Configurations/DebugRelease.xcconfig: Added.
