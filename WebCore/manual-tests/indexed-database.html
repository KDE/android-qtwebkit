<p>This is a test that only applies to IndexedDB.  <span id=enabled>Our test for whether you have it enabled seems to have failed.</span></p>

<p>Please follow these steps in order:</p>

<p>First, click <a href="javascript: doOpen(true)">here</a> to open an indexedDB database.  Look in the proper place in your file system (the place being specific to each port) and verify a file was created.  You should be able to open the file up with sqlite and examine it that way as well.</p>

<p>Next, close the browser, delete the file, replace it with some garbage, and make it read only to the user the browser is running as.  Now click <a href="javascript: doOpen(false)">here</a>.  You should get some sort of error.</p>

<p>Close the browser, delete the file you made, and click <a href="javascript: doOpen(true)">here</a>.  All should be well again.</p>

<p>Status: <span id=status>...</span></p>
