        - fixed uses of NULL in non-pointer contexts

        * khtml/khtml_part.cpp: (findWordBoundary): Changed NULL to 0 and did a little code
        cleanup of the surrounding code.
        * khtml/rendering/break_lines.cpp: (khtml::isBreakable): Changed NULL to 0 and did
        a tiny bit of cleanup.

        * WebCorePrefix.h: Add a definition of NULL here that takes advantage of the GNU
        __null feature even if the system C library doesn't.

        - fixed 3457831 -- REGRESSION: copying particular text and pasting (plain) produces lots of extra text

        * khtml/khtml_part.cpp: (KHTMLPart::text): Check for the end node when following a
        link to the parent node, not just when following a link to the next child node.
        * kwq/KWQKHTMLPart.mm: (KWQKHTMLPart::attributedString): Ditto.
