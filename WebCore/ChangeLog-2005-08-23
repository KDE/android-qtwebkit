        - fixed 3463624 -- page at cinemakorea.com shows up blank due to kTECBufferBelowMinimumSizeErr from TEC

        * kwq/KWQTextCodec.mm: (KWQTextDecoder::convertOneChunkUsingTEC): To work around the bug
        I found in the decoder (Radar 3351093), change kTECBufferBelowMinimumSizeErr to
        kTECOutputBufferFullStatus in cases where bytes were actually converted.

        - fixed 3463586 -- WebCore does not compile with new definition of NULL

        * khtml/khtml_part.cpp: (findWordBoundary): Changed NULL to 0 and did a little code
        cleanup of the surrounding code.
        * khtml/rendering/break_lines.cpp: (khtml::isBreakable): Changed NULL to 0 and did
        a tiny bit of cleanup.

        * WebCorePrefix.h: Add a definition of NULL here that takes advantage of the GNU
        __null feature even if the system C library doesn't.

        - fixed 3457831 -- REGRESSION: copying particular text and pasting (plain) produces lots of extra text

        link to the parent node, not just when following a link to the next child node.
        * kwq/KWQKHTMLPart.mm: (KWQKHTMLPart::attributedString): Ditto.
