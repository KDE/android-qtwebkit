WebCore is a framework for Mac OS X that takes the cross-platform
KHTML library (part of the KDE project) and combines it with an
adapter library specific to WebCore called KWQ that makes it work
with Mac OS X technologies. KHTML is written in C++ and KWQ is written
in Objective C++, but WebCore presents an Objective C programming
interface. WebCore requires the JavaScriptCore framework.

This version of WebCore is based on the KHTML library from KDE 3.0.2.
Changes that are specific to WebCore are marked with #if APPLE_CHANGES.
Other changes to improve performance and web page compatibility are
intended for integration into future versions of the KHTML library.

To build the WebCore framework tarball, you'll need Mac OS X 10.2,
including the development tools.

First build JavaScriptCore and either install it or set the environment
variables DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH to include the
directory that the JavaScriptCore.framework bundle is in.

Then build the WebCore project using either the Project Builder user
interface or using the command "pbxbuild" from the command line.
