        * editing/ReplaceSelectionCommand.cpp:
        (WebCore::ReplaceSelectionCommand::doApply):
        Removed the code to find out if we must later add smart replace whitespace.  We can 
        wait until we've done the insertion to figure it out, and the position sampled (startPos)
        to make the decision about trailing whitespace was wrong.
        Changed the order that work is done during a paste: 1) Insert everything 2) Do one of
        the following: a) handle a trailing interchange newline, b) uncollapse the last incoming
        br if it has been collapsed because of quirks mode, c) do an end merge 3) Add smart replace
        whitespace (2 and 3 were reversed because the end merge must happen before we can know
        whether or not we need to add a trailing space).
        Don't do an end merge if the last node inserted was a br because the end merge will 
        clobber it.
        
        (WebCore::ReplaceSelectionCommand::removeEndBRIfNeeded):
        brs where [br, 0] is at the end of a block and not at the start of the paragraph
        are the ones that are collapsed because of quirks mode.

        Rename isSpace to treatAsSpace.  Move it and the rounding hack function into
        Font and make them static methods (inlined in the header).  Make the rounding
        hack character table a static member as well.  Remove the redundant space/rounding
        functions from FontData.mm.

        - Fix for bug 8833. Removed inline keyword from functions declared
        in .mm and .cpp files. inline function code needs to reside in the
        header file for the linker to find the code.

        Fix for bug 8809, lift the Mac-specific WebTextRenderer code for
        drawing and measuring of runs up into the Font class.  The fast code
        path is in Font.cpp and is designed to be mostly cross-platform.  The
        slow code path is in FontMac.cpp and is Mac-specific.
