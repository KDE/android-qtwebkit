JavaScriptCore is a framework for Mac OS X that takes the cross-platform
KJS library (part of the KDE project), combines it with the PCRE regular
expression library and David M. Gay's floating point conversion
functions, and makes it work with Mac OS X technologies.

This version of JavaScriptCore is based on the KJS library from KDE
3.0.2. The few changes that are specific to JavaScriptCore are marked
with #if APPLE_CHANGES. Other changes to improve performance and web
page compatibility are intended for integration into future versions of
the KJS library.

To build the WebCore framework tarball, you'll need Mac OS X 10.2,
including the development tools.

Build the JavaScriptCore project using either the Project Builder user
interface or using the command "pbxbuild" from the command line.
