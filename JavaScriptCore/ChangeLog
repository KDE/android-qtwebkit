        - rolled in some CString changes Harri Porten did on the KDE side

        * kjs/ustring.cpp:
        (KJS::CString::CString): Use memcpy instead of strcpy for speed. Fix an off by one error
        in the copy constructor.
        (KJS::CString::operator=): Use memcpy instead of strcpy for speed.

        * JavaScriptCorePrefix.h: Add a definition of NULL here that matches the one in Merlot.
        This makes us see warnings that otherwise would be Merlot-only warnings.
