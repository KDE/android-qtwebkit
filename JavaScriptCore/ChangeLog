	- fixed 3413962 -  malicious web pages can kill all future JavaScript execution by breaking recursion limit check
	
        * kjs/nodes.cpp:
        (FunctionCallNode::evaluate): If we're going to return early due
	to breaking the recursion limit, make sure to lower it again, or
	it will creep up by one each time it's exceeded.

        * JavaScriptCorePrefix.h: Added a C case to the NULL definition since we use C as well
        as C++ in this project.

        - rolled in some CString changes Harri Porten did on the KDE side

        * kjs/ustring.cpp:
        (KJS::CString::CString): Use memcpy instead of strcpy for speed. Fix an off by one error
        in the copy constructor.
        (KJS::CString::operator=): Use memcpy instead of strcpy for speed.

        * JavaScriptCorePrefix.h: Add a definition of NULL here that takes advantage of the GNU
        __null feature even if the system C library doesn't.
