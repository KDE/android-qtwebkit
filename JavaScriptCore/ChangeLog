          Make fast*alloc() abort() on failure and add "try" variants that
          return NULL on failure.

        * JavaScriptCore.exp: Exported tryFastCalloc().
        * VM/RegisterFile.h:
        (KJS::RegisterFile::RegisterFile): Removed an ASSERT().
        * kjs/JSArray.cpp:
        (KJS::JSArray::putSlowCase): Changed to use tryFastRealloc().
        (KJS::JSArray::increaseVectorLength): Ditto.
        * kjs/ustring.cpp:
        (KJS::allocChars): Changed to use tryFastMalloc().
        (KJS::reallocChars): Changed to use tryFastRealloc().
        * wtf/FastMalloc.cpp:
        (WTF::fastZeroedMalloc): Removed null checking of fastMalloc()'s result
        and removed extra call to InvokeNewHook().
        (WTF::tryFastZeroedMalloc): Added. Uses tryFastMalloc().
        (WTF::tryFastMalloc): Renamed fastMalloc() to this.
        (WTF::fastMalloc): Added. This version abort()s if allocation fails.
        (WTF::tryFastCalloc): Renamed fastCalloc() to this.
        (WTF::fastCalloc): Added. This version abort()s if allocation fails.
        (WTF::tryFastRealloc): Renamed fastRealloc() to this.
        (WTF::fastRealloc): Added. This version abort()s if allocation fails.
        (WTF::do_malloc): Made this a function template. When the abortOnFailure
        template parameter is set, the function abort()s on failure to allocate.
        Otherwise, it sets errno to ENOMEM and returns zero.
        (WTF::TCMallocStats::fastMalloc): Defined to abort() on failure.
        (WTF::TCMallocStats::tryFastMalloc): Added. Does not abort() on
        failure.
        (WTF::TCMallocStats::fastCalloc): Defined to abort() on failure.
        (WTF::TCMallocStats::tryFastCalloc): Added. Does not abort() on
        failure.
        (WTF::TCMallocStats::fastRealloc): Defined to abort() on failure.
        (WTF::TCMallocStats::tryFastRealloc): Added. Does not abort() on
        failure.
        * wtf/FastMalloc.h: Declared the "try" variants.
