	These bugs both came up because a JavaScript function has a var
	declaration that collides with a function parameter name.

        (VarDeclNode::processVarDecls): Don't set the property to
	undefined if a property with that name is already set on the
	global object. Otherwise we may clobber function parameters with
	undefined even before hitting a possible var initializer.
