        Move WTF::notFound into its own header so that it can be used
        independently of Vector

        Rubberstamped by Darin Adler.

        * JavaScriptCore.vcproj/WTF/WTF.vcproj:
        * JavaScriptCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
        Added NotFound.h to the project.
        * wtf/NotFound.h: Added. Moved the notFound constant here...
        * wtf/Vector.h: ...from here.
