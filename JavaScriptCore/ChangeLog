        Re-structured variable and function declaration code.
        
        Command-line JS iBench shows no regression.
        
        Here are the changes:

        1. Function declarations are now processed at the same time as var 
        declarations -- namely, immediately upon entry to an execution context. 
        This does not match Firefox, which waits to process a function
        declaration until the declaration's containing block executes, but it 
        does match IE and the ECMA spec. (10.1.3 states that var and function 
        declarations should be processed at the same time -- namely, "On 
        entering an execution context." 12.2 states that "A Block does not 
        define a new execution scope.")

        2. Declaration processing proceeds iteratively now, rather than 
        recursively, storing the nodes is finds in stacks. This will later 
        facilitate an optimization to hold on to the gathered declaration nodes, 
        rather than re-fetching them in every function call.

        Removed surprising self-named "hack" that made nested functions 
        available as named properties of their containing functions, and placed
        containing function objects in the scope chains of nested functions.
        
        There were a few reasons to remove this "hack:"

        1. It contradicted FF, IE, and the ECMA spec.

        2. It incurred a performance penalty, since merely parsing a function 
        required parsing its body for nested functions (and so on).

        3. SVN history contains no explanation for why it was added. It was just
        legacy code in a large merge a long, long time ago.
